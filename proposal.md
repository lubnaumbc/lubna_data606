## Introduction:

•	Health-care fraud is a sort of white-collar crime that involves filing false health-care claims in order to make money. Anyone, from healthcare funds to fund members like us, can be affected by healthcare fraud. It occurs when someone, such as a healthcare practitioner or an individual, offers inaccurate or incomplete information in order to gain a financial advantage.

•	The fraud can be committed in many ways; double billing, Up-coding, Phantom billing.

•	It is estimated by the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association that there is a loss of around 68 billion dollars which accounts to 3 percent of nation’s spending in health care. 


## Questions I would like to address:

•	Using the claims filed by them, I would like to predict the likely fraudulent providers in healthcare 

•	I would like to find the key aspects that can assist in spotting possibly fraudulent suppliers' behavior

## Dataset Source:
Dataset downloaded from Kaggle. These files contain valid information about insurance scheme beneficiaries, patients who were admitted to the hospital and underwent some medical procedure and diagnosis (inpatient data), patients who visited the hospital for some procedure or diagnosis or both but were not admitted (outpatient data), and medical service provider IDs that have been tagged as potential fraud or not.

## Target variables and features:

•	Provider ID for each health care provider
•	Target column to indicate whether the healthcare provider is fraud or not.

## Models to be used:

I would like to use four machine learning models: logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier and XGBClassifier..
## Evaluation metric to be used:

Our dataset is unbalanced because most of the providers are not prospective fraudsters. Also, while flagging a supplier as a possible fraudster, we must be extremely cautious. The following measures can be used to assess model performance in this scenario:
•	Binary confusion matrix
•	Precision, recall, F1 score

## Outcomes:

With this project I expect to learn how to execute a machine learning project from beginning to end using a real-world dataset, feature engineering, working on different classification models and their evaluation.
With this detection of frauds one can feel ease in getting the Medicare they need and lowering the insurance premiums helping every class of society.
